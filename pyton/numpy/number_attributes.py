    This array is stored in memory as 40 bytes, one after the other (known as a contiguous block of memory). 
    The strides of an array tell us how many bytes we have to skip in memory to move to the next position along a 
    certain axis. For example, we have to skip 4 bytes (1 value) to move to the next column, but 20 bytes 
    (5 values) to get to the same position in the next row. As such, the strides for the array x will be (20, 4).
